    <p>This project was completed by a team of graduate students from Temple University as a part of Local Hack Day 2016.</p>

    <h3>Project Prompt</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the project was to provide an effective scheduling algorithm for a medical transportation service to pick up and drop off patients at appointments.</p>

    <h3>Challenges and Accomplishments</h3>
    <p>The team struggled with connecting to the database, and settling on an effective algorithm to represent the scheduling logic.  Ultimately, a solid design for the algorithm was developed, but time was too limited to realize a full implementation in the web app.</p>
